# Obscure File Format

After having downloaded then extracted the archive you will find three files, `a`, `k` and `l`.

- `a` and `k` have an unknown format. 
- `l` is a packed and heavily obfuscated python script.

The intended way of solving this challenge is to use patience, hands and a brain to reverse `l`.

When you're done with reversing `l`, you should have enough elements to understand how `a` and `k`
were made and how to decode them to get your flag.
