A long time ago, hackers spoke the same language. 

They were able to understand each other easily and they challenged H4x0r, father of all hackers.

H4x0r, realizing that hackers were conspiring against him, introduced many other languages to divide them.

Now it's a mess, we need encodings and we always argue about Python 3 being better than Python 2 (or the opposite)...

H4x0r is still hiding somewhere, waiting to find someone worthy of being told its secret to restore peace in the hacking world.

Me and my team tracked him down through time and space to finally get stuck on [this](https://static.ctf.insecurity-insa.fr/fc1fb6481ee711d32bcc8b715dc0c7e06b394d50-extra.tar.gz).

Will you help us find H4x0r and get its secret ?
