One of my friends is a show-off and I don't like that.

Help me find the backdoor he just boasted about! :D

You'll find an image of his USB key [here](https://static.ctf.insecurity-insa.fr/3b89ef8bb51773c8f3478bf356271ac762ec96c3.tar.gz).

And one last thing, my friend owns `you-shall-not-pass.ctf.insecurity-insa.fr`.
